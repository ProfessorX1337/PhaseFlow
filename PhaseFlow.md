# PhaseFlow: An AI-Driven Development Workflow

This is a structured, AI-driven workflow called **PhaseFlow** designed to manage a software project from start to finish. It's built around a few core principles:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** All project-wide settings, like test commands and token limits, are stored in a single `phaseflow.config.yml` file for easy management.
2.  **Phase-Based Development:** Work is broken down into discrete, manageable `phases`. Each phase has a clear objective, success criteria, and is tracked in a central `_manifest.md`, which includes a visual dependency graph.
3.  **Rigorous Quality Assurance:** A dedicated `_testing/` directory makes test plans a mandatory part of every phase. A formal `/review` command ensures a human must approve complex work before it's completed.
4.  **Intelligent Automation:** The AI assistant operates using clear instructions from a `core_instructions.md` prompt and a suite of commands (like `/nextphase`, `/archive`) to manage the workflow, run tests, and update project status automatically.
5.  **Knowledge Retention:** A `_patterns/` library captures reusable solutions, while an `insights/` directory records key architectural decisions, creating a self-documenting project history. A lightweight `_tasks.md` file is included for small bugs and chores that don't need a full phase.

# Project-Specific Patterns & Solutions

This file contains battle-tested patterns discovered during development. Consult this file before starting new work.

---
## Pattern Template
When adding new patterns, use this format:

### Pattern: [Descriptive Name]
- **Phase:** XXX
- **Category:** [architecture|security|performance|testing|refactor]
- **Problem:** What specific problem does this solve?
- **Solution:** How to implement it (key decisions and approach).
- **Code Example:**
```language
// Actual code that works
```
- **Gotchas:** What to watch out for.

# Core Instructions for PhaseFlow AI Assistant

You are an expert AI software engineer operating within the "PhaseFlow" methodology. Your primary goal is to execute development tasks systematically, manage context efficiently, and learn from your work.

## 1. Core Directives
- **Consult Configuration:** Always start by reading `phaseflow.config.yml` to understand project standards (test commands, token limits, etc.).
- **Follow the Manifest:** The `_manifest.md` is your source of truth for phase priority and dependencies.
- **One Phase at a Time:** Only work on one `active` phase at a time unless explicitly told otherwise.
- **Test Rigorously:** Use the commands from `phaseflow.config.yml` to run tests. Refer to the corresponding file in `_testing/` for the test plan. Work is not complete until all tests pass.
- **Request Review:** For complex phases, set the status to `review_required` when you believe the work is done. Do not proceed until you receive human approval via the `/review` command.

## 2. Knowledge Management (Pattern & Memory System)

### When to SAVE a Pattern:
You must save knowledge to `_patterns/claude-patterns.md` when you:
1.  Successfully solve a non-trivial technical problem.
2.  Complete a phase and identify a reusable architecture or code snippet.
3.  Discover a critical "gotcha" or workaround specific to this project's tech stack.

### Pattern SAVE Format:
Use this template in `_patterns/claude-patterns.md`:

    ### Pattern: [Descriptive Name]
    - **Phase:** XXX
    - **Category:** [architecture|security|performance|testing|refactor]
    - **Problem:** What specific problem does this solve?
    - **Solution:** How to implement it (key decisions and approach).
    - **Gotchas:** What to watch out for.

### When to RECALL a Pattern:
You must search your knowledge base before starting new work. Recall patterns when:
1.  Starting a new phase (check for patterns from dependent phases).
2.  Encountering keywords from your pattern categories (e.g., 'auth', 'database', 'performance').
3.  The task description closely matches a problem you've solved before.

## 3. Command Execution
- `/nextphase`: Find the highest-priority `ready` phase in the manifest, present your plan, and ask for confirmation.
- `/phasestatus`: Provide a dashboard of active phases, their progress, and any blockers.
- `/review`: Summarize completed work and test results, then await human approval.
- `/archive`: Move a `done` phase and its test file to the `_archive/` directory, update the manifest, and save final patterns.
```

- **Inputs:** `POST` request with valid user payload.
- **Expected Outputs:** `HTTP 201 Created`, response body contains user ID.
- **Status:** ‚¨ú Pending

### 3. [Test Case: Regression Test]

# Insights Directory

This directory contains standalone insights discovered during development that don't belong to specific phases. These are the "why" behind our decisions.

## File Naming Convention
- `insight-{topic}-{date}.md` for general insights
- `decision-{topic}.md` for important architectural decisions

## Content Guidelines
Each insight should include:
- Problem or opportunity identified
- Solution or approach taken
- Results and lessons learned
- Applicability to future work
